## Final project

The aim of this project is to predict plane trajectories more precisely. In specific, we eare interested in a regression analysis of the Cruise Climb Rate (FL 100 to FL 285, FL = flight level) using data of the Initial Climb Rate of the airplane. A successful prediction would be extremely useful for Controller Assistance Tools (CATO) of the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), which are currently being developed to warn and assist air traffic controllers at centers and towers.
The project is an actual research question of the research and development team of the DFS (Deutsche Flugischerung). They provide us with a sufficiently big data set (up to 30 days of aviation data).
